sentence=A library for managing low-power sensor operations on ESP32 and ESP8266 boards.
paragraph=ESPLowPowerSensor simplifies the implementation of low-power sensor projects by providing an easy-to-use interface for managing multiple sensors with different sampling intervals while optimizing power consumption through sleep modes. It uses an interrupt-driven approach for efficient sensor management.
